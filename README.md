# SwiftUI Various Architecture Examples PokedexApp
When developing an app with SwiftUI, there are many architecture options to choose from.     
Here, we will examine examples to explore the strengths and weaknesses of various architectures.    

## Here are the architectures covered:
#### MVVM    
#### MVI    
#### Clean Architecture    
#### Redux    
#### TCA    

## Getting Started
- Test code is also provided!    
- The code is written as FirstParty as much as possible,    
so if you want to focus on the architecture, please concentrate on the PokemonModule folder.     
- Each architecture pattern might not be perfect and is not the definitive answer.
