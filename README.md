# SwiftUI Various Architecture Examples PokedexApp
When developing an app with SwiftUI, there are many architecture options to choose from.     
Here, we will examine examples to explore the strengths and weaknesses of various architectures.    

## Here are the architectures covered:
#### MVVM    
#### MVI    
#### Clean Architecture    
#### Redux    
#### TCA    

## Getting Started
- The code is written as FirstParty as much as possible and includes test code.
- If you want to focus on the architecture, please pay attention to the PokemonModule.
- Each architecture pattern may not be perfect and is not the definitive answer. I am a junior iOS developer with only two years of experience.
