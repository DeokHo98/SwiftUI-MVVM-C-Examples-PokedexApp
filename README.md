# SwiftUI MVVM-C Examples PokedexApp
When developing an app with SwiftUI, there are many architecture options to choose from.     
Here, we will examine examples to explore the strengths and weaknesses of various architectures.    

## Getting Started
- The app is a very simple example with three main features: a basic list, a filtering function for the list, and navigation to a detail screen.      
- The code is written as FirstParty as much as possible and includes test code.
- If you want to focus on the architecture, please pay attention to the PokemonModule.
- Each architecture pattern may not be perfect and is not the definitive answer. I am a junior iOS developer with only two years of experience.
- Feel free to open an issue if there's something missing or you'd like to discuss further.
